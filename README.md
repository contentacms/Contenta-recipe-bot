## Contenta recipe bot

One major advantage of a decoupled approach is to have a rich data model, which
can be accessed from more places.

These days a really hiped feature are chatbots. This project provides one example
implementation using [botmaster.ai](http://botmasterai.com/documentation/latest/).
Please experiment with other tools, and please join the #contenta slack
